# Introduction

This is a simple shooting game, I made it from python to update my logical mind and tbh it is really fun to make games by yourself rather then doing the vibe coding.

# How to play

The main requirement is you must have Python installed in your system.

1) Clone this repo

```bash
git clone <repo-link>
```

2) Install pygame 

```bash
pip install pygame
```

3) Execute the `main.py` file

```bash
python ./main.py
```
